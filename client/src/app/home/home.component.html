  <h5>Our mission</h5>
  <br>
  <p class="mission-p">Our mission is to give every animal a chance for a better life, filled with care and love. We believe that every creature deserves a safe home and attention, regardless of its past. We work tirelessly to rescue animals in need, rehabilitate them, and find loving families that will welcome them as part of their lives.</p>
  <p class="mission-p">We strive to inspire the community to be more compassionate and responsible toward animals by organizing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. Our foundation also supports spay and neuter programs to help prevent unwanted litters and reduce homelessness.</p>
